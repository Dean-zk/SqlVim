## SqLVim

SqLVim is a minimalist Vim configuration, crafted to offer the power of modern IDEs while maintaining the lightweight and fast nature of Vim. The primary focus of this configuration is to eliminate lag, particularly when using the `x` command to delete characters in Neovim. This is a major issue in popular configs, most well known LazyNvim.

## Why SqLVim?

- **Minimalist**: SqLVim provides a stripped-down Vim configuration, allowing users to add only the features they need, minimizing bloat.
- **Speed**: Designed for speed, SqLVim ensures that Vim and Neovim remain responsive even during intensive editing tasks.
- **Customizable**: Feel free to customize SqLVim according to your preferences with lazy. Add plugins, mappings, or configurations as you see fit.
- **Ease of Use**: With SqLVim it just works. It's simple yet effective.

## How to Use/ Requirements üìñ

Before using SqLVim you need these packages:
- **NeoVim**: preferably the latest version.
- **Git**: To pull changes.
- **Unix based system**: Windows works aswell but I recently switched to Arch Linux, so it will be more focussed on UNIX.

## IMPORTANT ‚ö†
If you don't whether you should use the Windows or Unix version. GO WITH WINDOWS! Windows has less terminal functionality than Unix.
Because of that you are not required to download toals like TMux if you don't feel like it.

step 1. üì° Download the code and put it in the folder/directory based on your system:

**Unix**
```
~/.config/local/nvim
```
**Windows:**
```
~/.Appdata/local/nvim
```
step 2. There is no step 2. Enjoy your nvim config!

## What to expect the next major push üíæ
- **Adding debuggers?**: The file is there, but haven't actively tried working on it.
- **Transparency**: With the click of a button you have a transparent terminal editor.
- **Custom LuaLine**: A more compact and less bulky lualine.
- **Trouble.nvim**: This will add an error window in neovim to show errors in a better way.
- **Custom errors**: Adding a different way of showing errors.
- **Cleaning up files**: To enhance performance and keep it bare bone I will try to clean up the files.
