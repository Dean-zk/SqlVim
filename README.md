## SqLVim

SqLVim is a minimalist Vim configuration, crafted to offer the power of modern IDEs while maintaining the lightweight and fast nature of Vim. The primary focus of this configuration is to eliminate lag, particularly when using the `x` command to delete characters in Neovim. This is a major issue in popular configs, most well known LazyNvim.

## Why SqLVim?

- **Minimalist**: SqLVim provides a stripped-down Vim configuration, allowing users to add only the features they need, minimizing bloat.
- **Speed**: Designed for speed, SqLVim ensures that Vim and Neovim remain responsive even during intensive editing tasks.
- **Customizable**: Feel free to customize SqLVim according to your preferences with lazy. Add plugins, mappings, or configurations as you see fit.
- **Ease of Use**: With SqLVim it just works. It's simple yet effective.

## How to Use/ Requirements üìñ

Before using SqLVim you need these packages:
- **NeoVim**: preferably the latest version.
- **Git**: To pull changes.
- **Unix based system**: Windows works aswell but I recently switched to Arch Linux, so it will be more focussed on UNIX.

step 1. üì° Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dean-zk/SqLVim.git
```
step 2. There is no step 2. Enjoy your nvim config!

## What to expect the next push üíæ
- **TMux**: Out of the box TMux integration (ONLY FOR LINUX AND MAC).
- **Windows version**: I will probably create 2 nvim files. One for Windows and 1 for Unix.
- **Transparency**: With the click of a button you have a transparent terminal editor.
- **Better documentation**: This is mainly for if you want to make changes.
